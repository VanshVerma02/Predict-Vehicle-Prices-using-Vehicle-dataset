# üöó Vehicle Price Prediction

**Predict vehicle prices** based on specifications like make, model, mileage, fuel type, and more ‚Äî
built in Python with **Random Forest Regression** for accurate results.

## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to **estimate the market price of a vehicle** using historical listings and technical specifications.
It walks through the **complete ML pipeline** ‚Äî from **data cleaning** to **model evaluation** ‚Äî making it an excellent beginner project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning**

* Removed rows with missing `price`.
* Filled missing **numeric values** with the mean.
* Filled missing **categorical values** with the mode.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Engineering**

* Created `vehicle_age` = `current_year` - `year`.
* Dropped `year` column after transformation.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Encoding**

* Used **Label Encoding** for categorical columns.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training**

* Started with **Linear Regression** ‚Üí R¬≤ ‚âà 0.35 (low accuracy).
* Switched to **Random Forest Regressor** ‚Üí R¬≤ ‚âà 0.77 (high accuracy).

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation**

* **MSE:** `68,860,248`
* **R¬≤ Score:** `0.7745` (model explains \~77% of price variation)
* **RMSE:** \~`8,300 USD`

---

## üìà Results

‚úÖ **Accuracy improved from 35% to 77%** after switching to Random Forest.
‚úÖ **Prediction error reduced by \~6,000 USD** compared to the first model.
‚úÖ Ready for further tuning with gradient boosting models.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

* Extract **engine size** and convert to numeric for better predictions.
* Incorporate **brand popularity** or resale value index.
* Test **XGBoost** or **LightGBM** for performance improvements.
* Normalize skewed features like `mileage` and `price`.
